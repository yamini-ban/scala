# scala-assignment-day-three

Q1. Write a program to find Fibonacci series till a given limit using tail recursion.
	For example: If limit is 7
	Output: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8.

Solution is in Fibonacci.scala

Q2. Write a higher order function that takes three parameters with a function to calculate area of
rectangle, rhombus and parallelogram. Also use string interpolation and pattern matching with
default case.
	For Example:
	def area(shape: String, first: Int, second: Int, f:(Int,Int) => Int):String
	Input : area("rectangle",5,4,function)
	Output : Area of rectangle is 20
	Input : area("square",5,4,function)
	Output : Not defined yet for square.
Solution is in HigherOrderFunctions.scala

Q3 Using higher order functions, implement:
sum of squares
sum of cubes
sum of Ints
def sum(f: (Int, Int) => Int,a: Int, b:Int): Int
	For example:
	Input: sum(sqaure function, 5 , 4)
	Output: 41 (5*5 + 4*4)
	Input: sum(Ints function, 5 , 4)
	Output: 9 (5 + 4)
Solution is in Sum.scala
