Problem Statement

	Natural Language Understanding is the subdomain of Natural Language Processing where people
	used to design AI based applications have ability to understand the human languages. HashInclude
	Speech Processing team has a project named Virtual Assistant. For this project they appointed you
	as a data engineer (who has good knowledge of creating clean datasets by writing efficient code).
	As a data engineer your first task is to make vowel recognition dataset. In this task you have to find
	the presence of vowels in all possible substrings of the given string. For each given string you have
	to print the total number of vowels.

Input
	
	A string, eg: baceb

Output

	The vowel sum: 16

Explanation

	First line is number of input string, In given example, string is "baceb" so the substrings will be
	like -"b, ba, bac, bace, a, ac, ace, aceb, c, ce, ceb, e, eb, baceb" now the number of vowels in
	each substring will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 and the total number will be sum of all
	presence which is 16.

Constraints
	1. No vars

	2. No methods with side effects â€“ Unit

	3. No while loops
